# Vite + React + shadcn + TypeScript Starter Template

This is a starter template for creating a React app using Vite, TypeScript, and shadcn components, with strict ESLint rules and Git hooks using Husky and Conventional Commits. 

**Don't forget to change the default colors in `index.css`â€”these ones are placeholders and might not look great. You can use the [shadcn theme generator](https://ui.shadcn.dev) to make the color customization process easier.**

## Features

- Vite for fast builds and HMR
- React 18 + TypeScript
- shadcn components for UI
- Strict ESLint with TypeScript-aware rules
- Husky Git hooks for linting and enforcing Conventional Commits
